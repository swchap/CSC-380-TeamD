Dublin Core Extended (plugin for Omeka)
=======================================


Summary
-------

This plugin for [Omeka] adds the full set of Dublin Core properties to the
existing Dublin Core element set, including element refinements and supplemental
elements.

See [DCMI Metadata Terms].

An option allows to enlarge an advanced search on a base element of the
Dublin Core to its refinements, if any. This option applies when sorting items
too.


Installation
------------

Uncompress files and rename plugin folder "DublinCoreExtended".

Then install it like any other Omeka plugin and follow the config instructions.


Warning
-------

Use it at your own risk.

It's always recommended to backup your files and database so you can roll back
if needed.


Troubleshooting
---------------

See online issues on [Dublin Core Extended issues] page on GitHub.
